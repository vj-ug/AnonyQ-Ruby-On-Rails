# AnonyQ-Ruby-On-Rails

AnonyQ -- Startup Weekend Winner  (Confidential Seed funding)

Mobile Responsive web platform  to allow students anonymously ask questions to professors during class time.

"Students are afraid of embarrasment thinking their questions are too naive."
AnonyQ doesn't want to lose these precious gems -- the in-class questions.

As Oscar Wilde says "Give a man a mask and he will be his true self."

Hosted on Heroku.   

Professor and Student have their own screen.
