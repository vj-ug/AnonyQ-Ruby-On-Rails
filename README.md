# AnonyQ-Ruby-On-Rails

AnonyQ -- Startup Weekend Winner

Mobile Responsive web platform  to allow students anonymously ask questions to professors during class time.

"Students are afraid of embarrasment thinking their questions are too naive." 
AnonyQ doesn't want to lose these precious gems -- the in-class questions.
